'Speed' - Multiplies Particle Systems and Trails speeds.
'Loop' - Enable/Disable Particle Systems loop.

'Particle Systems' - The Particle Systems and Trails the prefab contains. Can be filled automatically with 'Fill Lists' button, or manually.
'Active Particle Systems' - Choose which Particle Systems and Trails are active. Can be filled automatically with 'Fill Lists' button, or manually.
'Fill Lists' - Finds and adds Particle Systems and Trails, of the parent and childs of current gameobject, to 'Particle Systems' and 'Active Particle Systems' lists.
'Empty Lists' - Emptys 'Particle Systems' and 'Active Particle Systems' lists.
'Apply' - It will apply the changes you made (Size, Speed, Loop, Lights Enabled/Disabled, Trails Enabled/Disabled, Change Color) to the particle systems in 'Particle Systems' that ARE active in the 'Active Particle Systems' list. It will also save the original settings in a folder called 'Original Settings' inside the folder of the vfx prefab.
'Reset' - Resets the Particle Systems and Trails to the original settings which are saved in a folder called 'Original Settings' inside the folder of the vfx prefab.

Workflow:
1) Add script to any VFX prefab;
2) Press 'Fill Lists' to automatically find and add Particle Systems and Trails to lists;
3) Make your changes (Size, Speed, Loop Enabled/Disabled, Lights Enabled/Disabled, Trails Enabled/Disabled, Change Color, Enable/Disable Particle Systems with 'Active Particle Systems' lists);
4) Press 'Aplly';
5) Script saves original settings and applies changes;
6) That's it, enjoy. 
PS: You can always press 'Reset' to go back to original settings.

Warnings:
1) Don't change the name of the VFX after you have pressed 'Apply'. Otherwise 'Reset' will not work since it wouldn't be able to find the original settings.
2) You can change the name of the VFX BUT you must go to the respective 'Original Settings' folder and copy paste the exact same name of the VFX.




SPAWN COMETS SCRIPT - DESCRIPTION:

Options:
'Comet' - The projectile to spawn.
'Start Point' - The spawn point from where the projectiles are going to spawn.
'End Point' - The destination of the projectiles.
'Delay' - Initial delay before it spawns the projectiles.
'Rate Of Fire' - The rate at which it spawns the projectiles in Quantity.
'Radius' - The radius for the projectiles to spawn.
'Quantity' - The number of projectiles to spawn.
'Waves' - How many times it repeats the process.

Workflow:
1) Add the Projectile you want to the 'Comet' in the inspector.
2) Assign the 'Start Point', which in this case it's a child called "CometSpawn" of the respective Magic Ability that has the 'Spawn Comets Script' attached.
3) Assign the 'End Point', which in this case it's the a Circle of the respective Magic Abilites that has the 'SpawnCometsScript' attached.
4) Choose the area of effect in the 'Radius'. It's a radius for the Start Point and End Point positions. Zero means it will spawn exactly in the 'Start Point' position and go the 'End Point' position (Speed is controlled in the 'Projectile Move Script' attached to the projectile).
5) In the 'Delay', choose how much time it will take for the first projectile to spawn. This is also the delay between each wave.
6) Select the 'Rate Of Fire' at wich the projectiles are going to spawn. Meaning that a rate of fire of 1 second will spawn a projectile each second, according to the amount assigned in the 'Quantity'.
7) Assign the amount of projectiles to spawn in the 'Quantity'.
8) Choose how many times this will repeat in the 'Waves'.

This are all just examples on how you can use this effects. Only simple code suggestions.




PROJECTILE MOVE SCRIPT - DESCRIPTION:
